So after checking with more knowledgeable people, it turns out this is 
the expected behavior on ARM and BAR regions should be mapped uncached 
on GK20A. All the more reasons to avoid using the BAR at all.

Yep, that's why I am seeking advice here. My first hope is that with a 
few tweaks we will be able to keep using TTM and the current nouveau_bo 
implementation. But unless I missed something this is not going to be easy.

We can also use something like the patch I originally sent to make it 
work, although not with good performance, on GK20A. Not very graceful, 
but it will allow applications to run.

In the long run though, we will want to achieve better performance, and 
it seems like a BO implementation targeted at UMA devices would also be 
beneficial to quite a few desktop GPUs. So as tricky as it may be I'm 
interested in gathering thoughts and why not giving it a first try with 
GK20A, even if it imposes some limitations like having buffers in lowmem 
in a first time (we can probably live with this one for a short while, 
and 64 bits will also be coming to the rescue :))

Thanks,
Alex.

Actually my mention of /dev/dri/cardX was misleading. I was rather 
thinking about getting rid of the DRIVER_MODESET flag to correctly 
expose what the card provides, not only to user-space, but to DRM 
itself. The legacy node is ok as long as DRM itself correctly knows what 
the driver can and cannot do and fails gracefully if the user tries to 
set a mode.

DRIVER_MODESET is statically set in nouveau_drm.c, and the reason why I 
cannot get rid of it is because the driver (and its features) is 
registered with drm_pci_init() before the card is probed and its actual 
features known.

For platform devices, you could check the card features before 
registering it with drm_platform_init(), but then you have the issue 
that the driver instance is referenced by every probed card, and thus 
you cannot have cards with different capabilities.

So it seems like handling this would require the driver_features to move 
from drm_driver to drm_device, but that's quite a core change. As 
pointed out by you and Daniel, we can certainly live with the control 
and legacy nodes. Nonetheless I'd be curious to know how (and if) this 
case can be correctly handled.

Alex.

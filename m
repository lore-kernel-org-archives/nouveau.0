It is my turn to apologize - I was (well still am, technically :)) on
holidays and have just started unpiling my inbox...

Indeed. For the first time with Maxwell GPUs, NVIDIA-provided firmware
will be required for GPUs to operate properly. This raises several
questions:

- Should the firmware be released under /lib/firmware/nouveau or
/lib/firmware/nvidia ? (this directory already exists for Tegra USB
firmware and makes more sense to me, since the firmware is not
Nouveau-specific)
- For GPCCS/FECS firmware, should we release the netlist "pack" file
or adopt the same format as Nouveau does? (1 file per firmware)
- Should we keep the current files names (e.g. nvxx_fucxxxx[cd]), or
try to switch to more meaningful ones?
- What about signature files that are required for secure boot?
- Knowing that NVIDIA's firmware ABI is a (very slowly) moving target,
it is worth to aim at ABI compatibility, or should we assume different
paths for Nouveau and NVIDIA firmware? If ABI incompatibilities are
introduced in the way, how do we handle versioning?

All these issues make me tend towards having a separate handling of
NVIDIA-released firmware (location, format, and ABI). It will also
make the firmware easier to release if conversions are not necessary
on the way out. What are your thoughts on this?

There may be legal issues with us touching the Nouveau firmware. But
as I stated above, the first question is do we want to bother with
this compatiblity at all?

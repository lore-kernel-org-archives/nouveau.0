Yes, this has been an issue that's been on my "really nice to
implement" list for quite a long time now, and only gotten around to
getting it partially done (as you can see).  Thanks for looking at
this!

=46or the moment, I've just got a couple of high-level
comments/questions on these patches so far before we worry about
nit-picking the details:

Is there any real need to have a full-blown notifier-style object to
pass this info back to userspace?  The DRM has an event mechanism
where userspace could poll on its fd to get events, which is what I'd
assume you'd be doing inside of fence waits with the error notifier?
NVIF events are actually hooked up to this mechanism already, so
userspace could directly request them and cut quite a lot out of that
first patch.  But, the NVKM-level passing of these events back over
NVIF is pretty much where I was going with the design too.  So, good
to see you've done that :)

 How

Is there any requirement to be able to adjust the priority of
in-flight channels?  Or would it be satisfactory to have these as
arguments to the channel creation functions?  Either way is fine, the
latter is preferred if there's no use case for adjusting it afterwards
though.

I'm attempting to get some better channel handling (you might have
noticed the current stuff the kernel uses is a bit fragile, it's
evolved over a long time and several generations of channel classes)
in place in time for 4.4, part of which will likely involve giving
userspace better control over the arguments that get passed at channel
creation time.

As for the permissions problem, that can be resolved fairly easily I
think, I'll play with a few ideas and see what I come up with.

Thanks,
Ben.

Will do that.

Do you mean, the init sequence? I haven't checked in detail (we are
certainly doing things differently in the non-DRM driver), but the
registers seem to match and the GPU is able to render after that. I
admit I have not looked much further for now.

The only register that does not exist on GK20A is 0x260, but when
accessing it Nouveau will be able to continue unharmed after a memory
fault.

I think it's indeed better to have a direct reference to the required clocks
to powergate/ungate a domain. As you said, there is no easy way to derive the
required clocks from the DT module declarations. My suggestion would be to
have powerdomain definitions in DT and for each domain have references to
the required clocks and resets.

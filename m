We already know that this is a patch. There is a chapter in
Documentation/process/SubmittingPatches which explains that. That file is
not only for newbies.

The copied boilerplate above is really nonsensical here. The default
address is 0, so the init function will emit:

     pr_err("you have to use the module argument mmio_address.\n");
     pr_err("DO NOT LOAD THIS MODULE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!\n");

Pretty useless when you can't supply a valid address.

       if (kernel_locked_down()) {
       		pr_info("This is not allowed because ...");
		return -EPERM;
       }

would make too much sense for the user, right?

Thanks,

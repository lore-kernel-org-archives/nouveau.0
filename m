With the limited time I spent studying it, it seems to me that Nouveau
has a strong dependency on VRAM. For gpuobjects indeed (that one could
be workarounded with a new instmem driver I suppose), and also for
TTM: objects placed in TTM_PL_VRAM are handled by the VRAM manager,
which requires a nouveau_ram instance in the FB. Actually the FB also
seems to assume the presence of a dedicated video RAM.

So while I agree that getting rid of VRAM altogether would be the most
logical solution, I have not found a way to do so for the moment.

T124's GPU actually sees the same physical address space as the CPU,
so memory management should be simplified thanks to that (you could
enable the SMMU and make things more interesting/complex, but for now
it seems untimely to even consider doing so). Actually even the
concept of a GART is not needed here: all your memory management needs
could be fulfilled by getting pages with alloc_page() and arranging
them using the GMMU. No GART, no BAR (at least for the purpose of
mapping objects for CPU access), no PRAMIN.

I really wonder how that picture would fit within Nouveau, and it is
quite likely that there is an elegant solution to this problem already
that my lack of understanding of Nouveau prevents me from seeing.
That's why your thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Alex.

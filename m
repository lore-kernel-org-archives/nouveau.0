The use cases do exist. I'll leave it up to the maintainers to decide
whether duplicate implementations or potentially unused generic
functions are to be preferred.

What I do know is that I have a driver in the wings that also needs a
strolower() implementation. If this ends up not being accepted, I'll
have to add yet another driver-local strtolower() implementation to
the kernel. But if that's the decision then so be it.

100% agreed. These functions won't set any speed records. Keep in mind
also that in 4 out of the 6 cases where I replaced local
implementations of "strcpytoXXX", the code was doing essentially the
same I am proposing here (no assembly code). Only 2 of the 6 called
strncpy() before, benefiting from optimized assembly implementations.
But they still had to walk the string explicitly afterwards to convert
the case, which probably means the overall speed won't change that
much using the functions proposed here.

That is also very true.

It adds 2 functions (strncpytolower() and strncpytoupper()). The other
4 are static inline one-liners and won't show up anywhere if not used
(and if used the compiler will insert calls to strncpyto<lower|upper>
instead).

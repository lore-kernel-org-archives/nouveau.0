I think you are correct in this.

       act_size = roundup_64(attr->length, MLX5_SW_ICM_BLOCK_SIZE(dm_db->dev));

Where we have:

#define MLX5_SW_ICM_BLOCK_SIZE(dev) (1 << MLX5_LOG_SW_ICM_BLOCK_SIZE(dev))

Which pretty much guarantees that it is a power of two. Thus, the real
fix here is simply to s/roundup/round_up/ as you suggest.

You mean define functions for round_up_size_{u|s}8/16/32/64

I'm curious to what the advantage of that is?

It may be simpler and perhaps more robust if we keep the char and short
cases.

I'm fine with adding something like this for round_up(), but do we want
to have a generic roundup_64() as well? I'm also thinking that we
perhaps should test for power of two on roundup():

#define roundup(x, y) (					\
{							\
	typeof(y) __y = y;				\
	typeof(x) __x;					\
							\
	if (__y & (__y - 1))				\
		__x = round_up(x, __y);			\
	else						\
		__x = (((x) + (__y - 1)) / __y) * __y;	\
	__x;						\
})

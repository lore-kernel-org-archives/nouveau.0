I think it needs to be more elaborate.

For instance, a system may have multiple DEVICE_PRIVATE map's owned by
the same driver - but multiple physical devices using that driver.

Each physical device's driver should only ever get DEVICE_PRIVATE
pages for it's own on-device memory. Never a DEVICE_PRIVATE for
another device's memory.

The dev_pagemap_ops would not be unique enough, right?

Probably also clusters of same-driver struct device can share a
DEVICE_PRIVATE, at least high end GPU's now have private memory
coherency busses between their devices.

Since we want to trigger migration to CPU on incompatible
DEVICE_PRIVATE pages, it seems best to sort this out in the
hmm_range_fault?

Maybe some sort of unique ID inside the page->pgmap and passed as
input?

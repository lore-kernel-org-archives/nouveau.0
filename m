That sounds reasonable to me.

We did write them unconditionally, prior to 04d9c1a1100b ("[PATCH]
PCI: Improve PCI config space writeback") [1].  That commit apparently
fixed suspend on some laptop.

But at that time, we restored the config space in order of dword 0, 1,
2, ... 15, which means we restored the command register before the
BARs and windows, and it's conceivable that the problem was the
ordering, not the rewriting of the same value.

Only a week later, we reversed the order with 8b8c8d280ab2 ("[PATCH]
PCI: reverse pci config space restore order") [2], which seems like a
good idea and even includes a spec reference.  I found similar
language in the Intel ICH 10 datasheet, sec 14.1.3 [3].

So it seems reasonable to me to try writing them unconditionally in
reverse order (the same order we use today).

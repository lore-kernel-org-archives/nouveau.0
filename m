A patch that programs VPR was merged into U-Boot (though I don't think
it's made it into master yet). I'm not sure we can reasonably check for
that in Nouveau, given that the register is somewhere completely
unrelated. In fact I think the U-Boot patch was triggered by some
discussion about how to solve this and it was decided that it shouldn't
be done in the kernel, but U-Boot should set it up.

That said, perhaps one solution would be to make U-Boot enable the gk20a
device if it's set up the VPR and disable it otherwise?

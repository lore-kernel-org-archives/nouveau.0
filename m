I had a brief look at this, and personally I don't think the CCF is a
very good match at all for how we're *supposed* to manage clock
frequencies as described by a discrete GPU VBIOS, and especially for
when we get to the point of using the PMU falcon to coordinate all the
various bits and pieces that go towards power management.

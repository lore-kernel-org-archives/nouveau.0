Sounds fine.

If that's possible, that'd be great.

If it's really that urgent, my suggestion is to submit the patches as
you did previously, keeping them confined to GK20A/GM20B, and I'll do
something nicer to support boards in general.

=46rankly, I'd have had secure boot support in the driver already had
NVIDIA played things a little differently...  Going forward, I'd like
to see NVIDIA not treating the Tegra parts of nouveau as a little
black box where anything goes and things are different from the rest
of the driver.  The chips operate, for the most part, identically to
their big siblings...

Thanks,
Ben.

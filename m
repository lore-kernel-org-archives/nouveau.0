Hi Lyude,

Thanks for the update, and good luck with the move! Totally understand =
being swamped=E2=80=94take your time.

Here is the patch with the original, concise commit message from 2024 =
restored (no LLM text, and only the single silent early-return patch):

---

From: Arjan Filius <iafilius@xs4all.nl>
Subject: [PATCH v2] drm/nouveau/disp: Prevent divide by zero after =
screen wake-up

On a Lenovo T430, dock, using DisplayPort and 2 4K external screens, a =
divide=20
crash happens in nv50_disp_super_2_2_dp() after waking up the screens =
when the=20
monitors were in power save (or switched to another input), because =
ior->dp.nr=20
drops to 0.

This causes:
- Screen lockup
- High system load after the issue is triggered
- Hangs during reboot

Fix this by returning early if the link has 0 active lanes (ior->dp.nr =
=3D=3D 0)
before doing the division calculations.

Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nouveau/-/issues/377

Conceptually I fully agree that we should use runtime PM and powerdomains.
However I don't think the implementation you mentioned is correct. The resets 
of all modules in a domain need to be asserted and the memory clients need to
be flushed. All this needs to be done with module clocks enabled (resets are
synchronous).  Then all module clocks need to be disabled and then the
partition can be powergated. After ungating, the module resets need to be
deasserted and the FLUSH bit cleared with clocks enabled.

Cheers,

Peter.

A lot of the time, there actually is a connector wired up. A lot of
the other time, there is no connector, but the display unit is still
there. Very recently, NVIDIA gpu's have started coming out marked as
"3d accelerator", which sometimes but not always means that there's no
display unit, and for those, I would assume there is no audio
subfunction.

However this is a fraction of all devices using runpm.

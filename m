Well I consider the TB and Optimus whitelisting as a stop-gap until
the BIOS date is lowered. Rafael wrote:

    Some time around when machines with Windows 10 started to ship should be
    relatively safe.
    I guess we can just pick a reasonable date in the initial patch and then
    try to move it back to the past subsequently and see if that breaks things
    for anyone.

Of course, I didn't mean this to be used as is, you'd have to augment
this with checks e.g. for presence of _PR3 and (if possible) Optimus,
but I'm not familiar enough with Optimus to write down working code
for it, I'm only familiar with apple-gmux switching.

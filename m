I'm sorry if I have offended you in any way, but would also appreciate
it if a less aggressive tone was directed towards me as well.

I have valid reasons to object to this patch, as stated in my previous
emails. The fact that the original feature has problems is of course
another story and, as I mentioned too, I'm willing to look into fixing
them.

I'm of course happy to review the rest of the series and even more
happy to help migrating this code to whatever is added there, as long
as the functionality is preserved.

Well, I guess we can disagree on this, because there is no clear
policy. I'm listed in the MAINTAINERS file for the subsystem and I
believe the purpose of the file is to list the people to CC on
relevant patches. We're all overloaded with work and having to look
through the huge volume of mailing lists like linux-media doesn't help
and thus I'd still appreciate being added on CC.

Best regards,
Tomasz

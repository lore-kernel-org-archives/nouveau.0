I've sent a couple of fairly trivial comments, as you saw, and I
suspect that others with a better understanding of the guts will have
more substantial architectural feedback, esp after the weekend/FOSDEM.
However, since no one's said it already -- welcome to Nouveau!

From the looks of it, you could bring up a full open-source stack with
your patches (i.e. Xorg + nouveau DDX + mesa) and use PRIME to render
stuff (assuming the actual display hw has an X ddx). Although I
suspect that you're going to want to use your own drivers. Still a
little curious if you've tried the open-source stack and whether it
worked. [Not sure what the status is of render-node support is in
mesa, but perhaps it's enough to try running piglit tests, if you
can't get X going with the display HW.]

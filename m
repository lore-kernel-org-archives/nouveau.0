Thanks! ^_^v

One beginner question: is it appropriate to send kernel patches to the 
nouveau list in addition to dri-devel? The moderation messages I receive 
make me think that this list might rather be intended for general 
discussion.

We are still testing things at libdrm level, but are eventually 
interested in bringing up the existing open-source stack. Our guess (and 
hope) is that it will work nicely almost as-is, minus the fact that the 
display hardware is not handled by Nouveau and we only support render 
nodes (I have yet to look at what the state of render nodes in Mesa is).

For X, Thierry is IIUC working on the display driver, and at some point 
these efforts should join to connect tegradrm and Nouveau using PRIME. 
We are not quite there yet, and since we are working with limited 
resources it will likely require some time, but the fact we could bring 
up a (seemingly) working Nouveau kernel driver with so little code is 
encouraging.

Thanks,
Alex.

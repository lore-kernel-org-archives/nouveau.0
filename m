I'm aware of that bug. I believe this is an exceedingly rare scenario
or it would have been reported a lot more.

Hm ok. Do you have the same laptop as the reporter of that bug?

Does this restriction (runpm being broken in presence of the audio
subfunction) only affect devices with _PR3? If so, that's a lot more
palatable - I bet Windows 8+ is in an era when the display-less thing
became more popular, and thus less likely to affect a ton of people.

Hi Greg,

The patches in this series are completely independent of each other, and
I would like the subsystem maintainers to apply them at their own
leisure.
Well, except for the last one, which I will apply only after there are
no more users of the transition helpers.

It is a bit awkward. I am sorry I haven't done this earlier. Quite a few
new drivers started using the old API after the explicit requests were
introduced last year.

I think it is better to let the drivers explicitly state what they
expect from the API, and using reset_control_get_exclusive vs _shared
helps driver developers to make a conscious decision.

Further, the implicit API call predates shared reset support, so it is
not clear that all of the old users really need exclusive control.
A few drivers have been switched to the shared API already.

I am not sure, there have been people arguing that the "clock-like" case
really is the common one. I suppose some of those drivers touched by the
100 patches in this series could also be changed to shared. But I don't
dare to make this decision for each of them.

I don't break anything here, and I'm absolutely fine with squashing
patches together per subsystem where that is preferable.

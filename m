Richard got distracted.  At present I'm grabbing the leds and backlight
patches and Richard is reviewing them as they fly past.

I don't see there's much point in me merging this patch series so if it
survives review, I'd suggest that you put it into an mjg tree and
thence into linux-next and mainline?

Well.  Even if it's uninitialised, the chances of the value being 1, 2
or 3 for all users are pretty small, so we'll still get to hear about
it if the runtime check is appropriately implemented.

OK, well please have a think about it, see what you can do to handle
unconverted (and possibly out-of-tree) drivers in a friendly fashion.

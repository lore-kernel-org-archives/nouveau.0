So, looking at the code more closely I noticed the nouveau_ram::get()
operation was only used by instmem (to allocate GPU objects) and TTM
(for BOs in VRAM).

I quickly wrote a custom instmem that allocates objects individually
with dma_alloc_coherent() (and manually builds a nouveau_mem instance
so they can be mapped into the BAR) and disabled nouveau_vram_manager
for TTM, making TTM_PL_VRAM BOs use the GART manager. And oooh, it
seems to work! :) I can remove that horrible CMA allocation and only
keep the nouveau_ram instance as a dummy object providing 0MB of
memory.

I think this should be a viable solution, BOs never need to be
contiguous thanks to the gMMU, and dma_alloc_coherent() returns
contiguous memory for instobjs (not sure if *all* instobjs need to be
contiguous in physical memory - page tables sure do - , but AFAICT we
never allocate crazy-big instobjs).

Any flaw/possible improvement with this design?

Alex.

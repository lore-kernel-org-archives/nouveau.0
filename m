Calling a function under condition A, which only does anything under 
condition B, when B depends on A, is identical in behaviour to only 
calling the function under condition B, except needlessly harder to follow.

What I was getting at is that arm_iommu_detach_device() already *is* the 
exact function Christoph was asking for, it just needs a minor fix 
instead of adding explicit set_dma_ops() fiddling at its callsites which 
only obfuscates the fact that it's supposed to be responsible for 
resetting the device's DMA ops already.

Tried enabling the DMA page allocation for GK20A. The great news is
that with it caching works as expected and that DMA API debugging does
not complain anymore when calling the sync functions. Actually, since
the DMA page allocator returns coherent memory, there is no need for
these sync functions anymore, which makes things easier. This seems to
be the simplest way towards enabling GK20A - albeit performance
suffers a little, but we can revisit that later once we have IOMMU
support.

I would not claim that we are fully compliant with what the DMA API
expects though. For instance, pages allocated for TTM via
dma_alloc_coherent() are later re-mapped in ttm_bo_kmap_ttm() using
vmap(), potentially with a different pgprot. The waste of address
space produced by these two simultaneous mappings aside, is this even
allowed? And when it comes to mapping these pages to user-space, TTM
does it without calling dma_mmap_coherent(), and again with whatever
flags we give it. IIUC memory allocated through the DMA API should
only be touched through the vaddr returned by dma_alloc_coherent(), or
through mappings provided by other DMA API functions. So is TTM
misusing the DMA API here?

In general, should we still be afraid of non-identical mappings on
modern CPUs like the A15 found in Tegra K1? I have heard contradictory
information so far and would really like to be able to understand this
once and for all, as it would give us more choices as for which memory
provider we can use.

Thanks,
Alex.

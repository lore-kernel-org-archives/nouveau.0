Hey Alex,

I mentioned a while back I had some stuff in-progress to make
implementing this a bit cleaner for you, but as you can probably tell,
I didn't get to it yet.  It's likely I won't manage to before the next
merge window either.  So, I'll likely take these patches as-is
(assuming no objections on reviews here) and rebase my stuff on top.

Interesting.  Can you give more details on how "PL" works exactly,
we'd been operating on the assumption (mainly inherited from code that
appeared in xf86-video-nv) that it was always a straight division.

It's something we can look to achieving down the road, but won't block
merging the support.

They don't *need* to depend on the BIOS, you can opt for an
implementation that doesn't use the base classes that the rest of the
dGPU implementations do.  But, it's fine to take the approach you've
taken.

Thanks!
Ben.

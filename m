Since it is apparently internal to the RPM core (I should go fix the references
to that which I added in amdgpu as well then, whoops...) I will have to figure
out another way to do this.

So: the reason that patch was added was mainly for the patches later in the
series that add guards around the i2c bus and aux bus, since both of those
require that the device be awake for it to work. Currently, the spot where it
would recurse is:

Suspending the MST topology at that point should be the right thing to do though
(and afaict, I don't -think- we reprobe connectors on resume by default), so I
definitely think we need some sort of way to have a RPM barrier here that
doesn't take effect in the suspend/resume path

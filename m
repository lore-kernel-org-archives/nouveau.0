Hello Lyude,

Yes, I did use generative AI to help refine and structure this (old) =
patch.
It is completely based on work/debug/fixing I had done manually few =
years back.=20
Generative AI helped me to send the message, but re-used my old patched =
code, brushed up a bit.
And tested it this week on kernel 7.1.3, but previous tested on 6.8.0.x =
and 6.9.9 kernels.

In 2024 i submitted a bug report/fix/workaround (to prevent a full =
lockup every day) on the Freedesktop GitLab under Issue 377:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nouveau/-/issues/377

Back then, my local workaround was a bit less elegant, and had a few =
extra checks/debug statements.
I had almost forgotten about the issue since my workaround was running =
fine.
When I recently booted up a clean mainline 7.1.3 kernel and saw the =
system freeze again within a day and every day,=20
and had to fsck my disks due to it, I remembered the fix I once debugged =
and posted in 2024.=20
I wanted to see if I could find a cleaner, more elegant solution and =
used AI for it, to see if the patch could be in a nicer place,=20
but ended up to basically reproduce the fix i had written in 2024 =
(without AI).


Regarding the two patches (A and B):=20
* **Patch B** was the version I compiled and tested locally with the =
`nvkm_warn()` statement
  so I could verify in `dmesg` that the standby transitions were =
actually triggering the block and being safely bypassed.
* **Patch A** is the exact same check but silent (without the warning =
logs).

To avoid any confusion i repeat my patch, which does not produce any =
logging every time,=20
but just avoids the lockup referencing null pointers when external =
displays goes to sleep.

```

This completely fixes my lenovo T430(NVIDIA NVS 5400M) + 4338 Dock and 2 =
external (multi-input) monitors freeze, proven over some years.
At the time the nvidia kernel driver on my T430 became an issue wih =
newer kernels, and notice nouveau driver did pretty well too.

Hope this claries it.

Best regards,
Arjan Filius

I don't think I have. Recent chips have similar capabilities, but they
don't have the restriction to a context bank, as far as I understand.
Adding Mikko who's had more exposure to this.

This doesn't actually fix anything on 64-bit ARM, and oddly enough I
haven't run into this issue myself on 64-bit ARM either. I think the
reason is that I haven't tested Nouveau on Tegra186 yet, which is the
first SoC which has an ARM SMMU. On prior 64-bit ARM chips we've used
the custom Tegra SMMU and that driver simply forbids creating any DMA
domains, so it will allow only explicit usage of the IOMMU API. There
is code in the generic DMA/IOMMU integration layer to not use the DMA
API with non-DMA IOMMU domains, but that's not true on 32-bit ARM,
unfortunately. It's entirely possible that Tegra186 will show exactly
the same problem that you are describing.

We do use the IOMMU API explicitly in the Tegra DRM driver as well,
and that is something that I've tested on Tegra186 and that I know to
be working. However, the reason why it works there is that the IOMMU
group will contain multiple display controllers, which will again
trigger a special case that will prevent the DMA/IOMMU integration
=66rom setting up a DMA domain for use with those devices.

This looks very interesting and simple, but I can imagine that it will
see significant pushback from the ARM SMMU maintainers (if not complete
silence), because it adds SoC-specific knowledge to an otherwise fully
generic driver. Having the GPU driver explicitly detach from the IOMMU
domain sounds like a better option, but I don't see how that would help
with the context bank issue that you're seeing.

One other possibility that I can imagine is to add something to struct
device that could be used by arch_setup_dma_ops() to not attach any of
the IOMMU-backed DMA operations to the device. Unfortunately that code
is called before the driver's ->probe() implementation is called, so a
driver doesn't have an opportunity to set it. Something like
of_dma_configure() could still set that up, perhaps based on some DT
property, though I can already hear the NAK from DT maintainers because
this is, after all, policy, not hardware description.

The last solution that I can think of that might allow us to do this is
to add a flag to struct device_driver (bool explicit_iommu?) that will
be used by the DMA/IOMMU setup code to decide whether or not to attach
to the IOMMU automatically.

Though, again, I'm not sure that would actually solve your bank problem.
That's really something I don't see any other solution than to fix it in
the ARM SMMU driver. Perhaps context bank 0 can always be reserved for
non-DMA domains?

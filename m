Do you mean that we should turn the Nouveau gk20a clock driver into a 
consumer of this CCF clock? I have nothing against this, but note that 
Nouveau can also perform DVS on its own, as the pstates can also contain 
a voltage to be applied to the volt device (not yet implemented in this 
series).

The question then becomes whether we want an additional layer of 
abstraction on these devices and whether the pre/post rate change 
notifiers give us any advantage compared to what Nouveau currently proposes.

dma memory should be removed from the kernel linear map (if needed)..
assuming it is allocated w/ dma api's.

btw, something I've been wondering for a little while, but haven't had
time to investigate.  Not sure if this applies to you as well.  But
seems like I have IOMMU's which can be outer-coherent (snoop L2), but
I *think* they are not inner-coherent (L1).  No idea if current dma
memory code can grok this and only do inner-cache op's..

Section alignment constraints somewhat save us here. The only example
I can think of a PMD not containing a uniform pgmap association for
each pte is the case when the pgmap overlaps normal dram, i.e. shares
the same 'struct memory_section' for a given span. Otherwise, distinct
pgmaps arrange to manage their own exclusive sections (and now
subsections as of v5.3). Otherwise the implementation could not
guarantee different mapping lifetimes.

That said, this seems to want a better mechanism to determine "pfn is
ZONE_DEVICE".

This whole situation is quite messy. The above sequence basically means
that drivers can't reset hardware modules because otherwise they might
race with the power domain code. It also means that we can't powergate
modules on demand because they might be in the same power domain as one
other module that's still busy.

How would we handle a situation where a hardware module hangs and we can
only get it back via a reset?

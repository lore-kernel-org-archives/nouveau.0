This will need some testing to get hard numbers, but I suspect that
invalidating the whole buffer isn't to bad as the prefetch machinery
works very well with the access patterns we see in graphics drivers.

Flushing out the whole buffer should be even less problematic, as it
will only flush out dirty lines that would need to be flushed on GPU
read snooping anyways.

In the long run we might want a separate cpu prepare/finish ioctl where
we can indicate the area of interest. This might help to avoid some of
the invalidate overhead especially for userspace suballocated buffers.

Regards,
Lucas

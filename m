There's a difference between having a reference and actually enabling the
clock. the domain powergate method will only be called when the clocks of
all modules in the domain are off. So the powergate method can then turn them
on again, do the module resets and client flushes and then disable them
again. Same for ungate. So I don't see a problem here?

Cheers,

Peter.

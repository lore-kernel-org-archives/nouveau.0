Why? You already have a way to get data out of and send commands to the
I2C devices themselves (Using the i2c_smbus_* functions). Why do you
insist on going through the I2C device drivers?

How is this relevant to the discussion? Are the clock chips connected
to the I2C bus too?

Hardware is very badly designed if the driver actually has to take care
of this. Thermal management should be handled by the hardware directly.
And as a matter of fact, the Analog Devices ADT7473 and the Fintek
F75375S support this.

I guess you mean I2C device, not i2c driver. You will have to be
precise in your wording if you want others to understand where you are
going.

When the I2C device isn't used for fan management, how is it done?

It only makes sense to instantiate a hwmon device from nouveau directly
if the temperature sensor or the fan management is _not_ done by an I2C
device. So it seems unrelated with your patch. Why are you mentioning
it then?

And clock speeds don't have anything to do with hwmon, BTW.

I can't remember this proposal. A link would be appreciated.

Do you mean that you don't have the code at all yet, or that you did
not include it in this patch set? Either way, this is wrong. There is
no point in asking for a review of only half of your solution. We can't
comment on the relevance of your proposal without seeing how you intend
to use it.

> > Looking forward to your review and feedback.

I have no plan to review your patch, sorry. You did not provide a
proper description of your problem, and you didn't explain why it can't
be solved with the current kernel infrastructures. Worse, you propose a
brand new hwmon subsystem, but you don't even provide a description of
its design, let alone an explanation of why you think this design is
appropriate. And you don't show us code using it either.

All I can say after a quick look at the patch, is that you are
overengineering a lot. You have enumerated all sensor properties which
exist, and are trying to handle all sensor types. You have a specific
need (thermal management of graphics cards), but you are already trying
to provide a generic access to all hwmon attributes which exist,
regardless of the needs or relevance. Do you really think you'll need
information about the case intrusion status in nouveau? Seriously?

I would be very curious to know how comes that the radeon driver
apparently works just fine without this change, if the nouveau driver
can't do without it.

My main concern is that the code you will have to add to every new
hwmon driver you will want nouveau to be able to use, is likely to be
larger than the code needed to access the device registers directly
from nouveau. Getting a temperature value from a hwmon device is
typically done with a single call to i2c_smbus_read_byte_data().

This will never be a good reason to reject a change, sorry. Just look
at the many changes the i2c subsystem went through in the past 2 years.
They make it difficult to backport i2c device drivers to older kernels,
but they still happened, because they were needed. When backporting a
driver, you have to deal with the history of the kernel at large,
that's life.

This is the kind of thing which would show up immediately if we could
see a few actual implementations of the hwmon driver side of the API.
In general, I would tend to agree with Guenter that exporting a dozen
functions from the hwmon core driver seems just wrong, especially given
the specific problem you claim you are trying to solve.

I don't plan to approve it either, at least not in its current state.
As I said above already, I want a complete description of the problem
first, an explanation of why the change is needed, why a more
lightweight solution wouldn't do, and why nouveau needs it when radeon
doesn't. And I want to see actual implementations of the API on both
sides.

Sorry but you can't push for a new API affecting 100 drivers without
justifying everything you do. An API with no implementers and no users
is not how you'll convince me.

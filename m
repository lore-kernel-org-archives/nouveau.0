I don't know if malidp makes any specific mistakes and didn't mean to
cast it in a negative light, sorry.

So a lot of DRM drivers acquire a runtime PM ref in the connector ->detect
hook because they can't probe connectors while runtime suspended.
E.g. for a PCI device, probing might require mmio access, which isn't
possible outside of power state D0.  There are no ->detect hooks declared
in drivers/gpu/drm/arm/, so it's unclear to me whether you're able to probe
during runtime suspend.

hdlcd_drv.c and malidp_drv.c both enable output polling.  Output polling
is only necessary if you don't get HPD interrupts.

You're not disabling polling upon runtime suspend.  Thus, if a runtime PM
ref is acquired during polling (such as in a ->detect hook), the GPU will
be runtime resumed every 10 secs.  You may want to verify that's not the
case.  If you decide that you do want to stop polling during runtime
suspend because it runtime resumes the GPU continuously, you'll need the
helper introduced in this series.  So by cc'ing you I just wanted to keep
you in the loop about an issue that may potentially affect your driver.

Let me know if there are any questions.

Thanks,

Lukas

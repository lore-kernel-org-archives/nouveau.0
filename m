I guess Alexandre will help you prepare this for upstream inclusion,
but just want to make sure that my main point makes it across -- this
is a 3K line patch. Please try to split it up into patches that add no
more than 300 lines at a time, preferably fewer (but this isn't always
possible). Ideally each patch should introduce one conceptual unit. Of
course different people might draw the line of "conceptual unit"
differently, but try to do it so that each one becomes 100-300 lines
of code :)

These aren't hard limits by the way, but good rules of thumb to go by
when sending patches for upstream inclusion.

Cheers,

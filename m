Will check that.

Actually, isn't it the case that we do not want to use TTM at all for 
stolen VRAM (UMA) devices?

I am trying to wrap my head around this since a while already, and could 
not think of a way to use the current TTM-based nouveau_bo optimally for 
GK20A. Because we cannot do without the idea of VRAM and GART, we will 
always have to "move" objects from one location to another, or deal with 
constraints that do not make sense for UMA devices (like in the current 
case, accessing VRAM objects through the BAR).

I am currently contemplating the idea of writing an alternative non-TTM 
implementation of nouveau_bo for UMA devices, that would (hopefully) be 
much simpler and would spare us a lot of stunts.

On the other hand, this sounds like a considerable work and I would like 
to make sure that my lack of understanding of TTM is not driving me to 
the wrong solution. Thoughts?

Thanks,
Alex.

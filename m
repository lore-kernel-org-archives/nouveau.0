There are a lot of moving parts here that are probably obvious to you
but not to me.  I need help untangling this a bit so I'm comfortable
that we got to the root cause and that we're doing something logical
as opposed to something that just happens to make things work.  I
really don't know enough to even ask the right questions...

Is there a bug report for this?  Bugzilla.kernel.org would be ideal,
including "lspci -vvxxx" and dmidecode for the system.

Is this running a current BIOS?  The date in your log below looks
pretty recent, so I assume it is current.

I assume "hybrid graphics" means you have two GPUs.  Do you select
hybrid graphics mode in the BIOS?

I assume when you say the Nvidia GPU doesn't get reset on a full
reboot, you're talking about a "warm reboot", and that if you actually
remove the power and do a cold reboot, there's no problem?

I assume Nvidia GPU being active means you are using the performance
GPU.  Does that mean the integrated GPU is completely unused and Linux
does nothing at all with it?  Is Linux doing any switching between
them?  If so, how?  I am not 100% confident in the code I've seen that
does the switching.

Was nouveau loaded *before* the reboot?  Or can you reproduce the
spurious interrupts even if you do a cold reboot without nouveau, then
a warm reboot again without nouveau?

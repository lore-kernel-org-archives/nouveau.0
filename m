Are these functions useful? =A0<shrug> Not to me, not so much.

None of the functions would have the strcpy performance of
the arch / asm
versions of strcpy and the savings in overall
code isn't significant (or
measured?).

Of course none of the uses are runtime performance important.

This patch also adds always compiled functions that aren't used
in many .configs.

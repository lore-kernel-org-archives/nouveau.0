"val" is uninitialized and used in this debug message.

To avoid adding another parameter and changing unrelated lines below,
what about:

    force = pdev->header_type == PCI_HEADER_TYPE_BRIDGE &&
        0x24 <= start && start <= 0x2c;

(or start == 0x28 || start == 0x24 || start == 0x28 if you want to be
very explicit). This would reduce in a smaller diff for this temporary
solution.

Kind regards,
Peter

One of the tricky things about DRM bindings in Rust is the fact that
initialization of a DRM device is a multi-step process. It's quite normal
for a device driver to start making use of its DRM device for tasks like
creating GEM objects before userspace registration happens. This is an
issue in rust though, since prior to userspace registration the device is
only partly initialized. This means there's a plethora of DRM device
operations we can't yet expose without opening up the door to UB if the DRM
device in question isn't yet registered.

Additionally, this isn't something we can reliably check at runtime. And
even if we could, performing an operation which requires the device be
registered when the device isn't actually registered is a programmer bug,
meaning there's no real way to gracefully handle such a mistake at runtime.
And even if that wasn't the case, it would be horrendously annoying and
noisy to have to check if a device is registered constantly throughout a
driver.

In order to solve this, we first take inspiration from
`kernel::device::DeviceContext` and introduce `kernel::drm::DeviceContext`.
This provides us with a ZST type that we can generalize over to represent
contexts where a device is known to have been registered with userspace at
some point in time (`Registered`), along with contexts where we can't make
such a guarantee (`Uninit`).

It's important to note we intentionally do not provide a `DeviceContext`
which represents an unregistered device. This is because there's no
reasonable way to guarantee that a device with long-living references to
itself will not be registered eventually with userspace. Instead, we
provide a new-type for this: `UnregisteredDevice` which can
provide a guarantee that the `Device` has never been registered with
userspace. To ensure this, we modify `Registration` so that creating a new
`Registration` requires passing ownership of an `UnregisteredDevice`.

V2:
* Make sure that `UnregisteredDevice` is not thread-safe (since DRM device
  initialization is also not thread-safe)
* Rename from AnyCtx to Uninit, I think this name actually makes a bit more
  sense.
* Change assume_registered() to assume_ctx()
  Since it looks like in some situations, we'll want to update the
  DeviceContext of a object to the latest DeviceContext we know the Device
  to be in.
* Rename Init to Uninit
  When we eventually add KMS support, we're going to have 3 different
  DeviceContexts - Uninit, Init, Registered. Additionally, aside from not
  being registered there are a number of portions of the rest of the Device
  which also aren't usable before at least the Init context - so the naming
  of Uninit makes this a little clearer.
* s/DeviceContext/DeviceContext/
  For consistency with the rest of the kernel
* Drop as_ref::<Device<T, Uninit>>() for now since I don't actually think
  we need this quite yet
V3:
* Get rid of drm_dev_ctx!, as we don't actually need to implement Send or
  Sync ourselves
* Remove mention of C function in drm::device::Registration rustdoc
* Add more documentation to the DeviceContext trait, go into detail about
  the various setup phases and such.
* Add missing period to comment in `UnregisteredDevice::new()`.
V4:
* Address some comments from Danilo I missed last round:
  * Remove leftover rebase detritus from new_foreign_owned()
    (the seemingly useless cast)
  * Remove no-op mention in Registered device context
V5:
* Fix incorrect size on Kmalloc (Deborah)

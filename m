This part is added in "[PATCH 2/11] memory: tegra: add mc flush support" 
and
"[PATCH 3/11] memory: tegra: add flush operation for Tegra124 memory 
clients"
for the hotreset registers.

Okay.

The tegra_mc_build_swgroup() is called during driver probe, and after that
the swgroup list is established and then the tegra_mc_find_swgroup() can 
work.

The tegra_mc_find_swgroup() is expected to be called outside the mc 
driver and
can only take the device node as argument because other drivers do not have
the mc instance information unless they call tegra_mc_find_swgroup() or
tegra_mc_find_client().

Yeah.

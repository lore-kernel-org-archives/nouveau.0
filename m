I think /lib/firmware/nvidia makes sense here too.

I'd actually prefer to have the entire netlists bundled, that gives us
updated reg/ctx production values too as you guys tweak/update them
for hw bugs (etc).  They're also nicer in that you get a single bundle
of everything that's required for that chipset+engine.

I don't have too much opinion on naming.  The current model of
nv{CHIPSET}_{UCODE_TYPE}{REGISTER_BASE}[CODE,DATA] was just nice and
convenient to snprintf into a buffer :)

As with above, if it's possible to ship them in a single file with the
ucode that it belongs to, that'd be ideal.  It's not a huge deal
though.

For incompatible changes, I think appending a -VERSION to each
firmware blob is probably the simplest approach.  The driver can
select the necessary codepath based on what it finds (probably trying
newer versions first, obviously).

I'm not entirely set here, either way.  I somewhat think that
initially I should adapt our interfaces to match, and a keep single
code path as long as we can.  A lot of the changes so far have seemed
minor enough we could stick conditionals on firmware version, and if
fw changes come along that warrant a radical change in handling from
the host, we can abstract it away then.

But, I'm open to other suggestions :)

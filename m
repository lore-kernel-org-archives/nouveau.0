I would agree with returning raw resource * if some of the consumer
code did make use of struct resource * directly, but AFAICT this is
not the case at all. So I thought we would better continue providing
exactly what the code needs, instead of forcing it to dererence the
resource itself. Also by doing so we might return NULL pointers in
some code paths that do not check whether a resource is valid or not
(granted, returning 0 would probably only make the code crash later).

That's true. Actually I wonder if it would not make more sense for
nouveau_device_platform_create_() to take a void pointer and a type
saying whether the device is PCI or platform, otherwise we will end up
duplicating the mutex code in two functions, ending up with even more
code than my current version.

Yes, I guess for particular chips it is ok to make assumptions such as
the presence of a given BAR that are, anyway, properties inherent to
that chip.

At some point I was considering having the bus abstracted as a subdev,
but that sounded overkill. :) A nouveau_device_ops * would provide a
nicer abstraction, but at the end of the day we would still be calling
accessor functions on a nouveau_device * and this would not change
much for consumer code. It would also deprive PCI-dependent code
(there is still a bunch) of a convenient way to access the pci_dev *
since it would need to be upcasted. And the only place where this
would remove nv_device_is_pci() is device/base.c.

IMHO the current situation is still sustainable for two buses. If we
had three or more, I'd go for the nouveau_device_ops * solution
though.

Maybe as a separate patch, yes. Also the value of "3" for non-PCI
devices is completely arbitrary.

I *think* drm_pci_device_is_agp() assumes a PCI device on purpose and
that the burden of checking is on the caller. Changing this behavior
would imply doing the same on many other functions of drmP.h.

Indeed, we can probably check drm_device::pdev in the functions themselves.

Yes, the current probing scheme is definitely not what we want.
However since some clocks probably need to be enabled before GK20A's
registers (including BOOT0) can be read, this will probably require
some more changes which we need to think about, and is not directly
within the scope of this patch.

Thanks for the review! I will post a v2 tomorrow.

This is crazy.  I would think *lots* of devices, like anything that
uses prefetchable memory, would be affected by this.

Can you use

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAD8Lp46Y2eOR7WE28xToUL8s-aYiqPa0nS=1GSD0AxkddXq6+A@mail.gmail.com

instead, so we don't depend on marc.info?  lkml.kernel.org doesn't have
linux-pci archives, but it might someday, and it does redirect to other
archives already.

I would really like to have a bugzilla.kernel.org issue with the
excellent debugging you and Peter did attached.  Then we don't also
have to depend on github.com, etc., sticking around.

The list of platforms below could also be attached there, since you
went to a lot of trouble to collect it, but it's probably more than is
necessary for the changelog.

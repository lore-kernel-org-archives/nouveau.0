final correction: I probably could actually get rid of this patch and do this
a bit more nicely by just making sure that we reprobe path resources for
connectors while under drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr->base.lock on CSNs, instead of
punting it off to the link address work like we seem to be doing. So, going to
try doing that instead.

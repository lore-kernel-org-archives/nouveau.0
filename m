Apologies if I sounded that way - I wasn't suggesting that we carry on
with this clearly illegal usage of the DMA API, but was merely noting
that if we were to implement the intended behavior on our side it
would look just like what the ARM implementation currently does. My
question about alternatives wasn't rethorical, I am not so familiar
with this part of the system (as should be obvious by now) and would
like to know whether there aren't other solutions that would spare us
the need to re-implement something that already exists.

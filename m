My point was: it might be necessary for some arches and not for others.

And as pointed by Arnd, the volatile is really only necessary for the 
dereference itself, should the arch use dereferencing.

So I guess the best would be to go in the other direction: remove 
volatile keyword wherever possible instead of adding it where it is not 
needed.

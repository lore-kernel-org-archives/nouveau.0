For that to work, we'd need the DT to say status="disabled" by default 
for the GPU, and for the fixed U-Boot (and indeed every other 
bootloader...) to enable the GPU node. This would allow people with old 
versions of U-Boot (or other bootloaders) to continue to boot. This 
means bootloaders would only have to set status="okay", but never have 
to set status="disabled", which at least simplifies them a tiny bit.

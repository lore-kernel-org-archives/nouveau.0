This is actually specific to Tegra.

I don't think lowmem or LPAE is any problem, if the memory manager is
designed with that in mind. Vast majority of the buffers kernel
allocates do not need to be touched in kernel space.

Actually I can't think of any buffers that we allocate on behalf of user
space that would need to be permanently mapped also to kernel. In case
or relocs only push buffer needs to be temporarily mapped to kernel.

Ultimately even relocs are not necessary if we expose GPU virtual
addresses directly to user space. But that's another topic.

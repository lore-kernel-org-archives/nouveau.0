And this is what I'm suggesting here.

We have avoided quite hard adding any form of those callbacks in the =

past and I don't really see a reason why that would have changed. For =

example see the discussion here: =

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-May/022388.html

Jerome and Dave rejected my approach for handling the sub allocator =

through a callback for exactly the same reason. And that was even for =

call chains inside the same driver, you're suggesting this for cross =

driver synchronization.

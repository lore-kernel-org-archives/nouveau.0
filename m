Yes, that's certainly possible and it'd be desirable to fix this up, but 
the same problem also applies to platform interfaces and it's typically 
unfixable there. My userspace implementation looks at the connector type 
to determine the best approach - if it's not LVDS or eDP it ignores the 
firmware and platform interfaces, so you'll fall back to the raw 
interface if it can provide support for your connector (presumably via 
ddcci, although we don't have this implemented yet)

Indeed. Removing the DRIVER_MODESET feature gets the driver to load
properly, but trying to actually use Nouveau (e.g. kmscube) crashes
in other places.

Now that you mention it, I vaguely remember trying to do something
similar a long time ago and I had to split up DRIVER_MODESET into more
fine-grained features (basically DRIVER_MODESET and DRIVER_LEGACY, if
I remember correctly) to avoid crashes. But this must have been three
or four years ago and I can't recall the exact details.

That's interesting. I think there'd be some symmetric elegance to it if
the PCI driver supported DRIVER_MODESET irrespective of the feature set
of the card and if the platform driver did the same. In the end, this
isn't really a driver-specific feature, but a device-specific feature.
Or to put it another way: the driver inherently supports modesetting
features, irrespective of a device's specific capabilities.

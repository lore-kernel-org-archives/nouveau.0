It is not obvious to me what solution you are proposing.. 

Are you saying that the detaching from the DMA IOMMU domain that is provided 
by dma_ops() implementer (ARM32 arch for example) should be generalized and 
hence there should be something like:

	dma_detach_device_from_iommu_dma_domain(dev);

that drivers will have to invoke.

And hence there will be dma_map_ops.iommu_detach_device() that dma_ops() 
provider will have to implement. Thereby provider will detach device from DMA 
domain, destroy the domain and update the DMA ops of the device.

If hardware has some restrictions, then that should be reflected in the 
hardware description. But that's not what we are trying to solve, at least 
there is no such problem right now for NVIDIA Tegra.

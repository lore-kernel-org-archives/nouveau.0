My point was that as long as anyone was keeping a reference the clock
couldn't in fact be turned off.

No, the power domain will be disabled when all devices in the domain are
idle.

I think that could work, but we'd need to make sure that drivers that
use runtime PM and are connected to a power domain enable clocks only
after taking a runtime PM reference and disable the clocks before they
release that reference.

So to simplify things, maybe all clock handling for drivers should be
moved into runtime PM operations, and whenever the driver needs the
clock enabled it takes a runtime PM reference. That would ensure that
clocks aren't accidentally left on.

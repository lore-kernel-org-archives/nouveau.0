Likely the clang compiler is the best option here.

It might be useful to add -Wunreachable-code-break to W=1
or just always enable it if it isn't already enabled.

(and thank you Tom for pushing this forward)

checkpatch can't find instances like:

	case FOO:
		if (foo)
			return 1;
		else
			return 2;
		break;

As it doesn't track flow and relies on the number
of tabs to be the same for any goto/return and break;

checkpatch will warn on:

	case FOO:
		...
		goto bar;
		break;

Interestingly, it turns out that the screen corruption occurs on every
boot (booting with nouveau.noaccel=1 for now), and I can consistently
work around it by one suspend-resume cycle.

To that effect, I've captured kernel message output booting 3.14-rc3
with 'nouveau.noaccel=1 nouveau.debug=trace,DEVINIT=spam drm.debug=0x6
log_buf_len=16M', and performed a suspend-resume cycle:

Ben et al, would some specific register tracing or otherwise help to
locate the issue?

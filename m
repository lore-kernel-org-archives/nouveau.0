Indeed.

Also, I was reflecting over lunch that the hmm_range_fault should only
return DEVICE_PRIVATE pages for the caller's device (see other thread
with HCH), and in this case, the caller should also be responsible to
ensure that the driver is not calling hmm_range_fault at the same time
it is deleting it's own DEVICE_PRIVATE mapping - ie by fencing its
page fault handler.

This does not apply to PCI_P2PDMA, but, lets see how that looks when
we get there.

So the whole thing seems pretty safe.

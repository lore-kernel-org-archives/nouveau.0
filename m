You've posted a lot of concerns, but I haven't seen you come up with any sc=
enario that could create a lockup and lockdep wouldn't warn about.

This is no longer true when you start synchronizing with other drivers. The=
 TTM core will see the intel fences and treat them no differently. That's t=
he entire reason for this conversion. It's also needed to remove the need t=
o pin dma-buf when exporting.

FWIW, reverting commit 89699605fe7cfd8611900346f61cb6cbf179b10a on 2.6.39-rc3+
makes my system boot just fine with the nouveau drivers compiled into the
kernel. I've seen some similar looking bugs on LKML that this regression may or
may not be related to? It works fine on 2.6.38.

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33272
http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/15/194

I'm still trying to figure out exactly where the kernel is crashing after
printing
[drm] nouveau 0000:03:00.0: allocated 1280x1024 fb: 0x40000000, b0 f4cf7600

Any thoughts on what else I should look for?

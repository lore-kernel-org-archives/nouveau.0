The thing about this is that it absolutely sucks for power-of-two arguments.

The regular roundup() that uses division has the compiler at least
optimize them to shifts - at least for constant cases. But do_div() is
meant for "we already know it's not a power of two", and the compiler
doesn't have any understanding of the internals.

And it looks to me like the use case you want this for is very much
probably a power of two. In which case division is all kinds of just
stupid.

And we already have a power-of-two round up function that works on
u64. It's called "round_up()".

I wish we had a better visual warning about the differences between
"round_up()" (limited to powers-of-two, but efficient, and works with
any size) and "roundup()" (generic, potentially horribly slow, and
doesn't work for 64-bit on 32-bit).

Side note: "round_up()" has the problem that it uses "x" twice.

End result: somebody should look at this, but I really don't like the
"force division" case that is likely horribly slow and nasty.

Sure, that would be more future-proof as well.

Yeah, I just followed the style of the file here. Whether it needs to
change or not is not my call. :P

Correct. As far as I have looked (that is, not very far), SW methods
are used for display-related functions, but there might be other
use-cases too. Maybe someone who knows better can confirm?

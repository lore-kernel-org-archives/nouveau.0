Yes, sadly the videobuf2 ended up becoming quite counterintuitive
after growing for the long years and that is reflected in the design
of this feature as well. I think we need to do something about it.

on this series is quite new to these areas of the kernel (although not
to the kernel itself) and it's my fault for not explicitly letting him
know to do that.

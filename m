Hi there,

These patches work as a starting point for more explicit error mechanis=
ms and
better robustness. At the moment, when a job hangs or faults, it seems =
that
nouveau doesn't quite know how to handle the situation and often result=
s in a
hang. Some of these situations would require either completely resettin=
g the
gpu, or a more complex path for only recovering the faulted channel.

To start, I worked on support for letting userspace know what exactly h=
appened.
Proper recovery would come later. The "error notifier" in the first pat=
ch is a
simple shared buffer between kernel and userspace. Its error codes matc=
h
nvgpu's. Alternatively, the status could be queried with an ioctl, but =
that
would be considerably more heavyweight. I'd like to know if the event m=
echanism
is meant for these kinds of events at all (engines notify errors upward=
s to the
drm layer). Another alternative would probably be to register the same =
buffer
to all necessary engines separately in method calls? Or register it to =
just one
(e.g., fifo) and get that engine somehow when errors happen in others? =
Please
comment on this; I wrote this before understanding the mthd mechanism.

Additionally, priority and timeout management for separate channels in =
flight
is added in two patches. Neither is exactly what the name says, but the=
 effect
should be the same, and this is what nvgpu does currently. Those two pa=
tches
call the fifo channel object's methods directly from userspace, so a ha=
ck is
added in the nvif path to accept that. The objects are NEW'd from kerne=
l space,
so calling from userspace isn't allowed, as it appears. How should this=
 be
handled?

Also, since nouveau often hangs on errors, the userspace hangs too (wai=
ting on
a fence). The final patch attempts to fix this in a couple of specific =
error
paths to forcibly update all fences to be finished. I'd like to hear ho=
w that
would be handled properly - consider the patch just a proof-of-concept =
and
sample of what would be necessary, supporting this question of mine aga=
in.

I don't expect the patches to be accepted as-is - as a newbie, I'd appr=
eciate
any high-level comments on if I've understood anything, especially the =
event
and nvif/method mechanisms (I use the latter from userspace with a hack
constructed from the perfmon branch seen here earlier into nvidia's int=
ernal
libdrm-equivalent). The fence-forcing thing is something that is necess=
ary with
the error notifiers (at least with our userspace that waits really long=
 or
infinitely on fences). I'm working specifically on Tegra and don't know=
 much
about the desktop's userspace details, so I may be biased in some areas=
=2E

I'd be happy to write sample tests on e.g. libdrm for the new methods o=
nce the
kernel patches would get to a good shape, if that's required for accept=
ing new
features. I tested these to work as a proof-of-concept on Jetson TK1, a=
nd the
code is adapted from the latest nvgpu.

The patches can also be found in http://github.com/sooda/nouveau and ar=
e based
on a version of gnurou/staging.

Thanks!

I think adding a BACKLIGHT_TYPEUNKNOWN as the first item in the enum,
sanity checking the array bounds and printing a warning if type is not
one of the defined values would be good.

I also want to make sure you think this patch is going to scale with
multiple GPU output machines? Thats the main reason I've held off any
patch like this as it doesn't help solve that problem as far as I can
tell. Yes, we have the device parent information and I see later in the
patch series you ensure the backlight is registered against the
connector which is good. If you have an ACPI "firmware" control that you
say should always be preferred, how do we know which connector device
that corresponds to in the multiple output case? From that point of view
this model falls apart?

What I really want to avoid is a new interface which just papers over
cracks, only to have everything crumble anyway.

Cheers,

Richard

The much bigger reductions in size would be from getting rid of all
the stuff that's not used at all on a GK20A, like all the firmware,
and a whole bunch of logic. I had a series that split things up into
nv04/nv50/nvc0 categories. I believe it was considered undesirable due
to increased build complexity. (It wasn't a nice modularized
separation but rather just a compile-time setting.) Shouldn't be too
hard to regenerate though.

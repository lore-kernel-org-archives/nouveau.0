It's fairly unlikely that Tegra DRM will ever need to be able to deal
with Vulkan (I'm not sure if the pre-Tegra124 GPU is capable of it). But
you're right, might be a good idea to plan for this anyway since it
isn't really complicated and we still have a few reserved bits left.

Yeah, the obvious advantage here is that this is totally trivial to
implement both in the kernel and in userspace. Extending it to an array
requires introduction of an extra structure (for a <fence, flags> pair)
and a u64 for the address and a u32 for the number of elements in the
array.

Another thing I'm wondering is if we can't simplify this somewhat by
only supporting syncobjs and then use the SYNCOBJ IOCTLs to convert to
FD if it turns out that we need it.

Let's say we have a use-case where we decode an video frame using a
hardware decoder (which we don't support upstream yet). The decoder
could signal completion using a syncobj. Userspace could then grab the
handle for that syncobj and pass it back in as prefence for a job that
does post-processing using VIC. They both are behind the same DRM
device, so the handle can be resolved properly. The VIC job could then
return a fence via syncobj handle. But in order to pass it to KMS we'd
need to convert it to an FD for synchronization. But we can do that
using the SYNCOBJ IOCTLs already, so there's not really a need for the
SUBMIT IOCTL to support emitting FDs, right?

Given that KMS and VIC are behind the same DRM device, would it be
reasonable to allow KMS to take a syncobj handle as in_fence_fd (perhaps
via in_fence_handle property)?

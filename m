Since it's written by someone else your s-o-b counts as full review (wrt
drm-misc rules at least as implemented by dim). So sounds like you have
review for all the bits.

Please make sure all maintainers of other bits are ok with that and have
given their formal ack for merging through drm-misc. With that you have
until end of this week (but don't cut it too short) to sneak it into 4.17.
Otherwise just push and it'll land in 4.18.

I think you've got all the other pieces.

--- Comment #12 from jr <j-r-BGeptl67XyCzQB+pC5nmwQ@public.gmane.org> ---
Thanks for pointing at the bug. I looked at it before filing this one. Cannot
say now why I discarded it as a potential duplicate without testing the trace.

You'd be less impressed if I told you how long it took:-) But I'm probably
better at debugging old than writing new code. And it did help that I do have
some experience with compilers even if that was decades ago (when SSA was a new
thing). Unfortunately after I changed jobs 7 years ago I had to drop pretty
much all my free software activities due to severe lack of energy. I do miss
that time, though. Feel free to mail me, if you want me to look at something.

Do you know what Windows does then? I think we should do the same if
possible.

If user has disabled runtime PM from the root port deliberately, there
might be good reason to do so. Why we want to fallback to something that
could cause problems? I mean _DSM on such systems is probably not that
much tested because everybody runs Windows 8+ and using standard ACPI
power resources.

Since using only _DSM has been the only method to power down the card
currently in=C5=84Linux (even if the root port has had _PR3), and it ha=
s been
working fine, why not stick with that when _DSM is supported?

In other words, something like this:

	nouveau_dsm_pci_probe()
	{
		...
		if (retval & (NOUVEAU_DSM_HAS_OPT | NOUVEAU_DSM_HAS_MUX)) {
			/*
			 * We have custom _DSM method to power down the card so
			 * prevent the PCI core from transitioning the
			 * card into D3cold.
			 */
			pci_d3cold_disable(pdev);
		}
	}

(Not sure about those flags above, though).

Yes, it does not follow Windows 8+ but if it works... ;-)

You mean for allowing bridge_d3? I don't think checking _PR3 helps us i=
n
any way. We can put PCIe port into D3hot just fine without any help fro=
m
ACPI. Only thing that matters here is that we should be able to do that
safely without causing problems to hardware which does not support it
properly.

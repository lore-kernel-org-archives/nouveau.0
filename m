In some cases, the function acquiring the runtime PM ref is only called
from a couple of places and then it would be feasible and appropriate
to add a bool parameter to the function telling it to acquire the ref
or not.  So the function is told using a parameter which context it's
running in:  In the runtime_suspend code path or some other code path.

The technique to use current_work() is an alternative approach to figure
out the context if passing in an additional parameter is not feasible
for some reason.  That was the case with d61a5c106351.  That approach
only works for work items though.

This broke my ilk (and presumably snb-bdw as well).

Also I can't see that any of the repostings of this has undergone the
full CI run (just BAT results are visible). Not sure why that is.
Not that the full run would have caught this because we unwisely 
load the module before the tests start. Which means any failures
during initial readout/takeover will not be flagged :(

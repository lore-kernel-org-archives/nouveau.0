There are ways to query this in a chipset-independent way.  However,
despite reporting it as an error if no copy engines are available, the
code should continue on without the channel happily.  Perhaps we can
just punt the relevent error messages to a debug loglevel for now?

I use the former in a few places, despite it not entirely being
"correct".. It looks nicer though :)  I don't mind either way though.

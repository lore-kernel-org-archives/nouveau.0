List-Id: nouveau.vger.kernel.org

The postclose handler can run after the device has been removed (or the
driver has been unbound) since userspace clients are free to hold the
file open the file as long as they want. Because the device removal
callback frees the entire nouveau_drm structure, any reference to it in
the postclose handler will result in a use-after-free.

To reproduce this, one must simply open the device file, unbind the
driver (or physically remove the device), and then close the device
file. This was found and can be reproduced easily with the IGT
core_hotunplug tests.

To avoid this, all clients are cleaned up in the device finialization
rather than deferring it to the postclose handler, and the postclose
handler is protected by a critical section which ensures the
drm_dev_unplug() and the postclose handler won't race.

This is not an ideal fix, since as I understand the proposed plan for
the kernel<->userspace interface for hotplug support, destroying the
client before the file is closed will cause problems. However, I believe
to properly fix this issue, the lifetime of the nouveau_drm structure
needs to be extended to match the drm_device, and this proved to be a
rather invasive change. Thus, I've broken this out so the fix can be
easily backported.

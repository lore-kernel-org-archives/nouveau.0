I think the dependencies could be in the driver. Of course the power
domains are per-SoC data, so really shouldn't be in the DTS either (the
data is all implied by the compatible value) but there's no good way to
get at the clocks and resets without DT, so I think that's a reasonable
trade-off.

It seems to me like there are only two dependencies:

	DIS and DISB depend on SOR
	VE depends on DIS

That's according to 5.6.6 "Programming Guide for Power Gating and
Ungating" of the Tegra K1 TRM. It also seems like a bunch of modules are
part of seemingly unrelated domains. Especially SOR seems to cover a
large range of modules (MIPI-CAL, DPAUX, SOR, HDMI, DSI, DSIB and
HDA2HDMI).

Given that we may want to more fine-grainedly control clocks to save
power, don't we need to control clocks and resets within the drivers? I
think the runtime PM framework makes sure to call this in the right
order, so for suspend, the sequence would be:

	1) device->suspend
	2) domain->suspend

and for resume:

	1) domain->resume
	2) device->resume

But then we're back to square one, namely that the MC flush doesn't work
properly, since it needs to be implemented in domain->suspend. Does that
mean we can't clock-gate modules? In order to ensure a proper powergate
sequence, the domain code would need to clk_enable() the module clock to
make sure it stays on during the reset sequence. But if the domain code
has a reference to the clock, then the driver can't clock-gate the
module anymore by calling clk_disable().

Am I missing something?

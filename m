The way ODP seems to work is once in hugetlb mode the dma addresses
must give huge pages or the page fault will be failed. I think that is
a terrible design, but this is how the driver is ..

So, from this HMM perspective if the caller asked for huge pages then
the results have to be all huge pages or a hard failure.

It is not negotiated as an optimization like you are thinking.

[note, I haven't yet checked carefully how this works in ODP, every
 time I look at parts of it the thing seems crazy]

When the driver takes faults it has to repair the MR mapping, and
fixing a page in the middle of a variable length SGL would be pretty
complicated. Even so, I don't think the SG_GAPs feature and ODP are
compatible - I'm pretty sure ODP has to be page lists not SGL..

However, what ODP can maybe do is represent a full multi-level page
table, so we could have 2M entries that map to a single DMA or to
another page table w/ 4k pages (have to check on this)

But the driver isn't set up to do that right now.

It would work, but the driver has to expand that into a page list
right awayhow.

We can't even dma map the biovec with today's dma API as it needs the
ability to remap on a page granularity.

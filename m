Hi, sorry it took me so long to get back to this - I've been busy with some
other responsibilities at work that came up last moment.

So I did try making it so that we cancel hpd_work from pci_driver->shutdown
and wait for it to complete, however that didn't really mseem to make any
difference. I did however try adding a workaround in the past that would shut
down the GPU whenever the kernel was shutting down (basically calling
nouveau_drm_remove() on shutdown) and that did actually fix the issue though,
but I didn't go with it as a final solution because of the problems it would
cause if we tried shutting down the card when it's in a bad state we could end
up hanging the whole system.

Do we want to have this discussion on the bz btw, or is this email thread
fine?

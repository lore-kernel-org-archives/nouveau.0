Hi PCI/ACPI PM experts,

Since Linux 4.8, nouveau switched to rely on the PCIe port driver to
transition to D3cold. This however does not happen for an Acer Aspire
V7-582PG (Haswell, NVIDIA GTX 750M) from Rick.

Any idea why? acpidump, lspci, dmesg and other details can be found in
the linked bug below.

Kind regards,
Peter

Right.  There were people that didn't have MMU notifiers that wanted
support for the GPU.  For a lot of older APIs, a lack of userptr
support was not a big deal (it just disabled some optimizations and
API extensions), but as it becomes more relevant it may make sense to
just make it a requirement.

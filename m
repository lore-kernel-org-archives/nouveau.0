I think initially I was waiting for the DRM patch "drm/nouvea: support 
for probing platform devices" to be applied, but it looks like that's 
been applied already, so only patches 4 and 5 in this series are still 
outstanding.

Alex, wasn't there also some issue where the VPR register had to be 
programmed, and if it wasn't there'd be a hang when the GPU registers 
were touched? If we've added code to Nouveau/tegradrm to detect that and 
avoid the problem, then I guess we can commit these last two patches for 
3.19. A resend after the 3.18 merge window might help.

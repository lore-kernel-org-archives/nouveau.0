Hi Lyude,

First of all, thanks a lot for looking into this.

I'm not sure if that variable is actually private to the PM core.
Grepping through the tree I only find a single occurrence where it's
accessed outside the PM core and that's in amdgpu.  So this looks
a little fishy TBH.  It may make sense to cc such patches to linux-pm
to get Rafael & other folks involved with the PM core to comment.

Also, the disable_depth variable only exists if the kernel was
compiled with CONFIG_PM enabled, but I can't find a "depends on PM"
or something like that in nouveau's Kconfig.  Actually, if PM is
not selected, all the nouveau_pmops_*() functions should be #ifdef'ed
away, but oddly there's no #ifdef CONFIG_PM anywhere in nouveau_drm.c.

Anywayn, if I understand the commit message correctly, you're hitting a
pm_runtime_get_sync() in a code path that itself is called during a
pm_runtime_get_sync().  Could you include stack traces in the commit
message?  My gut feeling is that this patch masks a deeper issue,
e.g. if the runtime_resume code path does in fact directly poll outputs,
that would seem wrong.  Runtime resume should merely make the card
accessible, i.e. reinstate power if necessary, put into PCI_D0,
restore registers, etc.  Output polling should be scheduled
asynchronously.

Thanks,

Lukas

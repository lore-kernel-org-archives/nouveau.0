Hmm that first assumption is not guaranteed by the dev_pagemap core.
The dev_pagemap end of life model is "disable, invalidate, drain" so
it's possible to call devm_munmap_pages() while pages are still mapped
it just won't complete the teardown of the pagemap until the last
reference is dropped. New references are blocked during this teardown.

However, if the driver is validating the liveness of the mapping in
the mmu-notifier path and blocking new references it sounds like it
should be ok. Might there be GPU driver unit tests that cover this
racing teardown case?

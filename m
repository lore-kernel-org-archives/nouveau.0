This series adds support for probing platform devices on Nouveau, as well as
the DT bindings for GK20A. It doesn't enable the GPU yet on Tegra boards since
a few extra things need to be supported before that.

This version is mostly identical to v2 but fixes an important issue: the drvdata
must be set to the drm_device for sysfs to work, so the platform device
structure now includes the nouveau_device flattened into it to let us compute
the address of one from the other. Since the platform device resources (clocks,
regulators, ...) need to live longer than the nouveau_device, they are stored
into their own structure which is allocated separately.

Changes since v2:
* Allocate the nouveau_device flattened into the nouveau_platform_device to
  be able to compute one from another easily, without having to ressort on the
  drvdata which is required to store the drm_device.
* Only propose the platform driver if a supported arch (Tegra for now) is
  enabled.
* Move structure definitions into their own header file as some subdevs (e.g.
  clocks) will need to use them.

Changes since v1:
* Moved the platform device driver to its own module. This allows it to be more
  self-contained and saves us the need to export too many functions from
  nouveau_drm and nouveau_platform.
* Register the DRM device without using the platform helpers, which is made
  possible by drm_dev_set_unique(). This allows us to catch and register the
  DRM device during platform probe.
* Fixed the clock names in the DT bindings.
* Removed the patches enabling GK20A on Venice2 and Jetson TK1 as support
  is not complete yet.

Hi Lv,

I am trying to reduce the number of parallel discussion we have on the
same subject, but there is something here I can't let you have.

But these two modes are wrong in the absolute case:
- a laptop has no reasons for not being powered up with the lid
physically closed (wake on lan?) -> so open is an approximation
already made on good assumption that there is not a high chance of the
users powering/resuming the laptop with the lid closed
- in the "close" case, this setting works for docked laptops, but if
the laptop can be docked, it can also be undocked. And if you boot
with button.lid_init_state=3Dclose, undock your laptop, go into suspend,
resume -> the lid state is now "closed" while it should be opened.

So no, these are just workarounds. i915/nouveau expect the acpi/button
state to be reliable, or they should ignore it. But you can't fake
events when you are not absolutely sure of what is happening.

I understand all of that. But my point is still that on some
platforms, the lid acpi state is not reliable, and the code in
i915/nouveau is not made for those platforms. So the ideal solution is
to know which platforms are problematic and take the right decisions
having everything at hands. Just "fixing" the internal API won't help
teaching these drivers to not make the assumption that the _LID acpi
call is always correct.

So yes, nouveau/i915 might need to be fixed, but IMO, fixing
acpi/button to report correct (true, accurate, actual, or physical if
you prefer) is the best, future proof way (minus platform quirks).

Benjamin

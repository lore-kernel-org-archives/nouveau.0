In the light of that it could be that the vram_domain member I am 
introducing is completely useless - if we set NV_VRAM_DOMAIN to be the 
following:

#define NV_VRAM_DOMAIN(screen) ((screen)->vidmem_bindings == 0 ? 
NOUVEAU_BO_GART : NOUVEAU_BO_VRAM)

then I suspect we can just live without it. I tested quickly and it 
seems to work. Ilia, do you agree? Or could we imagine having GPUs with 
VRAM for which none of the PIPE_BIND_* targets should reside in VRAM?

Also thinking, prior to setting vidmem_bindings to 0, shouldn't we also 
do a "sysmem_bindings |= vidmem_bindings" to make sure all the set 
bindings are tracked somewhere?

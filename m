Note: I did read your response lower down in the thread, but I wanted to make
sure I addressed one of the comments here (see below)

I did actually try this route after first finding this bug, but unfortunately
from what I understand there isn't really much more Lenovo can do other then
give us a patched BIOS or look at their own BIOS to see if it's the cause. 

Anyway, went ahead and filed a bug with as much information as I could get my
hands on here (different email then the one I'm talking to you from):

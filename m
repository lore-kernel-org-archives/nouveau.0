Maybe you are right, the chipset can not support MSI...

But why after your call pci_enable_msi(), the MSI address and data register is nothing initialized.

You can set bus_flags or global pci_msi_enable flag by add quirk function.
You can refer to examples in drivers/pci/quirk.c

Linux support some broken chipsets or devices to disable msi during device initialization by add quirk.

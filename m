You may want to make yourself aware of all the quirks required for
sharing memory between the GPU and CPU on an ARM host. I think there are
far more involved than what you see now and writing an replacement for
TTM will not be an easy task.

Doing away with the concept of two memory areas will not get you to a
single unified address space. You would have to deal with things like
not being able to change the caching state of pages in the systems
lowmem yourself. You will still have to deal with remapping pages that
aren't currently visible to the CPU (ok this is not an issue on Jetson
right now as it only has 2GB of RAM), because it's in systems highmem,
or even in a different LPAE area.

You really want to be sure you are aware of all the consequences of
this, before considering this task.

Lucas

A quick note: this isn't a problem unique to nouveau; I already have
(apparently incorrect according to pm runtime maintainers) hacks that fix
these in amdgpu that I'm planning on reapproaching with a proper fix.

That being said: i915 is also more of a special case compared to other
drivers, mainly because i915 does still have to deal with all these problems
but has it's own handlers that simplify dealing with it. For runtime resume,
you guys call down to disable_rpm_wakeref_asserts() during a portion of the
runtime suspend process to avoid the potential of something trying to grab a
runtime power reference and deadlocking the process, and additionally do the
same thing in your irq handler in i915_irq.c:

	/* IRQs are synced during runtime_suspend, we don't require a wakeref
*/
	disable_rpm_wakeref_asserts(dev_priv);

This essentially translates to the same thing that we're doing here with
nouveau: preventing any calls that would potentially call down to
pm_runtime_resume() so that the runtime suspend handler won't deadlock while
trying to disable HPD irqs. Likewise-this also ensures that you can call
intel_pm_runtime_get()/intel_pm_runtime_put() much lower on the stack without
having to worry about the potential for deadlocks.

While I haven't addressed it in this patchset yet, I pretty much want to do
the same thing for handling nouveau's current issues with i2c and dp aux: grab
runtime power references deeper, and avoid resuming the device in runtime
suspend/resume callbacks.

You did mention in the review of one of my other patches that we should avoid
disabling polling during runtime suspend, and you're definitely right. I feel
a bit silly for not remembering that since I was the one who made it so that
i915 does polling in runtime suspend for chips without RPM HPD detection in
the first place because it was causing people's displays not to come up on
vlv...
Anyway: I think if we just leave output polling enabled during runtime suspend
that might actually fix all of the fb_helper locking issues since we won't
need to wait on any of the output poll workers to finish, at least I think it
should: I'll confirm this when I get into the office

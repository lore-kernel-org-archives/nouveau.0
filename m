Yes, that would make it a one step process to access another
device's migrated memory pages.
Right now, it has to be a two step process where the caller calls
hmm_range_fault, check the struct page to see if it is device
private and not owned, then call hmm_range_fault again with
range->pfns[i] |= range->flags[HMM_PFN_DEVICE_PRIVATE] to cause
the other device to migrate the page back to system memory.

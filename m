For the coherency issue part you may want to look at my Nouveau on ARM
series. Most of it never made it upstream, as I lacked the time to work
further on this, but it solves the coherency issue from the kernel.

It does so by doing the necessary manual cache flushes/invalidates on
buffer access, so costs some performance. To avoid this you really want
to get writecombined mappings into the kernel<->userspace interface.
Simply mapping the pushbuf as WC/US has brought a 7% performance
increase in OpenArena when I last tested this. This test was done with
only one PCIe lane, so the perf increase may be even better with a more
adequate interconnect.

Regards,
Lucas

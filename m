[note to David Ober: you -should- be able to reply to this, hopefully, but I
haven't actually tested that so results may vary]

Hi again! Sorry I didn't fully answer all of the questions you originally
asked in this email, I had to get in contact with Lenovo to make sure that it
was OK for me to disclose more details on this bug (and I had PTO scheduled
immediately after I asked). I've added David Ober from Lenovo to this thread
as well. So now that I've got Lenovo's approval I can answer those questions,
and give some better answers for the others! (see below)

I lied: yes there actually is a bug report for this, but it's currently on the
Red Hat bugzilla. I can get more information from it if you need (with
lenovo's approval of course).

And additionally: I've been working with Lenovo on this issue for a couple of
months now, and we've gone through dozens of different trial BIOSes with no
success thus far. However, Lenovo is currently working on trying to add this
workaround into their BIOS but I've been told that this change is going to
take a decent amount of time since they need to test it across multiple
operating systems. I'd be happy to come back and add a conditional later to
turn this workaround off for later BIOS versions once Lenovo has released a
proper fix.

With all of that being said, [how] do you think we should proceed?

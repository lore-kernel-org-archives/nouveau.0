I would have hoped so, but unfortunately it seems that
pm_runtime_no_callbacks() is already called by default for i2c adapters in
i2c_register_adapter(). Unfortunately this really can't fix the problem
though, because it will still try to runtime resume the parent device of the
i2c adapter, which still leads to deadlocking in the runtime suspend/resume
path.

Additionally; I did play around with ignore_children, but unfortunately this
isn't good enough either as it just means that our i2c devices won't wake the
GPU up on access.

I'm pretty stumped here on trying to figure out any clean way to handle this
in the PM core if recursive resume calls are off the table. The only possible
solution I could see to this is if we could disable execution of runtime
callbacks in the context of a certain task (while all other tasks have to
honor the runtime PM callbacks), do what we need to do in suspend, then re-
enable them

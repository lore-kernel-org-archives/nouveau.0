I agree here.  It would be good to cover this gap and possibly backport
the fix to "stable".

I agree with Bjorn here.

So let's first fix what's known broken and see how this goes IMO.

On top of that and later, try to make the changes suggested by Bjorn and see
how far we can get with that.

Having done that, revisit and see if there still are any problems to address
in this area.

Thanks,

Depends, I think for this specific example I think my cleanup is better.

For the generic case you could use nested mutexes, which will give you a
different lockdep class when you need it. It's probably better to have those
cases where you do need to nest locking annotated:

mutex_lock_nested(&mutex, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);

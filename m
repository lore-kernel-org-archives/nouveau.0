Well, ideally it would have landed in the backlight tree when I sent it 
months ago. Then we'd have the opportunity to ensure that everything was 
fixed up before it went in in the merge window.

Depends entirely on whether they kzalloc the structure or not before
calling backlight_device_register().

The worst case I can think of is that we walk off the array - I guess 
there's an argument for sanity checking that in backlight_show_type().

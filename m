Thanks. You will probably notice that these patches won't apply to your 
tree and require some tweaking. I will probably end up sending a v2 
anyway, so maybe you should wait for it. If you want to try this version 
anyway, I have fixed-up patches against your tree.

Note that your tree currently won't build against -next because it uses 
drm_sysfs_connector_add/remove which are not available anymore (replaced 
by drm_connector_register/unregister I believe).

Oh and while I'm at it, there seems to be a typo in line 131 of clock.h, 
which should read _nouveau_clock_fini and not _nouveau_clock_init.

The pl_to_div table in clock/gk20a.c should give the right coefficients, 
but I have seen contradictory information in our docs. Let me ask the 
right people so we can get to the bottom of this.

Great, thanks!

At first I did not use the base classes for the gk20a clock 
implementation, but it resulted in replicating some init code and I was 
concerned that this might be a source of bugs in the future (e.g. clock 
base clock init gets updated but not the gk20a init). So I preferred the 
current approach which keeps everything in the same place.

Since you have no concern with it I will apply the same to volt and 
therm, and we can then get rid of patch 1. Then I should probably send 
you a v2 once the PL thing is cleared.

Cheers,
Alex.

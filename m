Yes, I'm leaning strongly towards doing that conversion now. The problem
with extending the reset API with flushing is that it will make the
conversion more difficult than it already is. I'm not even sure we can
go through with the conversion without breaking DT ABI stability yet
again. We may be able to do so by keeping the current code as fallback
if we can determine that no power domain is added (dev->pm_domain?). But
adding tegra_mc_flush() calls everywhere now will mean that we have to
keep even more fallback code, basically forever.

I know this is going to take some time, but the longer we defer this the
more work it will become. And we've already been pushing this back for
over a year.

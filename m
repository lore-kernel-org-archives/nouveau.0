This is an extremely complex change just for the benefit of one driver,
with a huge potential of misuse. The changes required in each driver
to actually implement the API are substantial, and pretty much only add
complexity to each hwmon driver with no real benefit.

The cost gets even larger if one has to consider that some may want or
have to to backport drivers to earlier kernel versions. This patchset
would result in significant efforts to do such backports.

For the API itself, there are lots of functions with similar parameters, 
and those parameters are needed in the drivers to determine which attribute
is affected. A single function would have accomplished the same, as the drivers
will need case statements anyway to identify the actual attribute to be read
or written. What we end up here with is a large number of functions to be
supported by each driver, all with pretty much the same set of arguments.

I don't know what current thinking is about kernel size increases, but it
looks like this patch will result in quite significant kernel size increase
(some 18*8 = 144 bytes per driver for all the pointers, plus the actual 
functions, adds up to a lot). Again this would be with no benefit for most
of the users of the hwmon subsystem. Sure, one can argue that the size increases
will only occur if the drivers are actually loaded, but that is a pretty weak
argument since the code size increase will still show up in each driver.

In summary I am not in favor for this change. Maybe Jean thinks differently,
but for my part I don't plan to approve it.

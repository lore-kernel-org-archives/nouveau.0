For some reason the audio function tends to disappear/hide, so maybe it
is not as problematic as it appears (see
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75985). For my laptop I
also had to runtime suspend/resume before lspci -H1 shows the device,
loading with runpm=0 didn't return my HDMI audio device.

The powered on issue will also only appear on devices produced in 2013
and newer that happen to have this ACPI _PR3 ACPI method (which is quite
common for new machines supporting Windows 8 though).

For these newer laptops, after the pci/pm merge and after a patch like
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-pci/msg52601.html, the user can
revert to the old DSM method by booting with pcie_port_pm=off which will
retain the current behavior.

The advantage of this patch is that it fixes memory corruption on some
devices. The risk is that the card stays on because the audio subsystem
needs some more work.  FWIW, I was working on some patches that properly
suspended in presence of the HDA controller, but somehow the audio
device was not properly resumed resulting in "no AFG or MFG node found"
and "snd_hda_intel 0000:01:00.1: no codecs initialized".

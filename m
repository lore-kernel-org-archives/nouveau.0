Some fields are readonly (device/vendor ID), others have side-effects
(write-to-clear semantics like Master Data Parity Error in the Status
register).

So in addition to always write the registers, what about writing only a
subset? Following the logic applied by Windows, for Type-1:

- Restore memory-related stuff:
  - Restore BAR0 (offset 0x10, dword).
  - Restore BAR1 (offset 0x14, dword).
  - Restore I/O Base + Limit (offset 0x1c, WORD, not dword).
  - Restore Memory Base + Limit (offset 0x20, dword).
  - Restore Prefetchable Memory Base + Limit (offset 0x24, dword).
  - Restore Prefetchable Base Upper 32 bits (offset 0x28, dword).
    (+wait for 500us, why?)
  - Restore Prefetchable Limit Upper 32 bits (offset 0x2c, dword).
    (+wait for 500us, why?)
  - Restore I/O Base + Limit Upper 32 bits (offset 0x30, dword).
    (+wait for 500us, why?)
  - Restore Expansion ROM Address (offset 0x38, dword).
- Restore at offset 0x3c:
  - Restore Interrupt Line (offset 0x3c, byte).
  - Restore Bridge Control (offset 0x3e, word).
    (+read value again, why? Some kind of flush?)
- Restore at offset 0x18:
  - Restore Primary Bus Number (offset 0x18, byte).
  - Restore Secondary Bus Number (offset 0x19, byte).
  - Restore Subordinate Bus Number (offset 0x1a, byte).
  - (Restore Secondary Status (offset 0x1b, byte)? Not seen in Windows.)
- Restore at offset 0x0c:
  - Cacheline Size (offset 0x0c, byte).
  - Primary Latency Timer (offset 0x0d, byte).
- Restore at offset 0x04:
  - Restore command register.
    (+wait for 500us)
  - (Actually Windows clears BM+Mem+I/O bits, then sets
    PCIE.DeviceControl=7, PCIE.DeviceControl2=0 and then enables
    BM+Mem+I/O again).
  - Restore (or write to clear?) Status (offset 0x06, word).
- Note that the following fields are omitted (mostly readonly):
  - Device ID + Vendor ID (offset 0x00, dword).
  - Revision ID + Class Code  (offset 0x08, dword).
  - Header Type + BIST (offset 0x0e, byte + byte).
  - Capabilities Pointer + Reserved (offset 0x34, dword).
  - Interrupt Pin (offset 0x3d, byte).

This is more complicated than the current loop, but the logic of writing
addresses first and then configuring others sound reasonable to me.

Kind regards,
Peter

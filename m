Good for me - actually that's the solution I implemented first before
deciding to go "=C3=A0 la Nouveau". ;) Some extra code will be needed, =
but
nothing crazy, and we will limit that feature to these chips for which
NVIDIA officially provides the firmware.

Since the firmware will be provided by us, shall we store it into
nvidia/<chip>/gpcfe.bin on linux-firmware?

So here we actually have several files - it is kind of a mess
actually. However I could probably merge them into a single netlist
file like we did for the GPC/FE CS code.

I agree. Hopefully we won't have too much of this.

Right now my main concern is to get secure boot support in, and the
shortest path seems to be to not care about ABI compatibility between
Nouveau and NV firmwares (at least for PMU). Basically I am hoping
that you will agree to proceed this way in a first time. ^_^

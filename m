The problem is that I see no way how to use the current API.  To know
the huge page size you need to have the vma, and the current API
doesn't require a vma to be passed in.

That's why I suggested an api where we pass in a flag that huge pages
are ok into hmm_range_fault, and it then could pass the shift out, and
limits itself to a single vma (which it normally doesn't, that is an
additional complication).  But all this seems really awkward in terms
of an API still.  AFAIK ODP is only used by mlx5, and mlx5 unlike other
IB HCAs can use scatterlist style MRs with variable length per entry,
so even if we pass multiple pages per entry from hmm it could coalesce
them.  The best API for mlx4 would of course be to pass a biovec-style
variable length structure that hmm_fault could fill out, but that would
be a major restructure.

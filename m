Yes-there is only one exception in the tree that I know of (amdgpu/radeon),
but fixing that is on my todo if someone else hasn't already gotten to it yet.

Yeah, that's what I thought as well! This experience has taught me that
there's a surprising amount of things about BIOSes that BIOS engineers don't
seem to know about…

Works for me, tested on the problematic P50 as well.

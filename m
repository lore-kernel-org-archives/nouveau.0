An interesting fact: if I change ttm_bo_kmap_ttm() such as kernel
mappings of BOs are always performed write-combined, and leave the
TTM_PL_TT default caching to TTM_PL_FLAG_CACHED so user-space mappings
remain cached, the corruptions just vanish. It seems to be the fact of
setting user-space mappings to anything non-cached that leads to this
puzzling behavior. Certainly some subtlety of ARM mappings are getting
over my head here.

If we need to implement different policies for kernel and user-space
mappings, this might complicate things a bit, especially since support
needs to be in TTM and not only Nouveau. I will submit a RFC tomorrow
if I don't hear better ideas by then.

Alex.

So Rick has tested this patch now on top of 4.8.4 (mainline fails to
boot due to a kbuild issue which I reported elsewhere), but the output
is empty. That seems to indicate that flags.power_resources is unset.

Given that _PS3 exists and is indeed a package with some elements, it
seems that acpi_extract_power_resources is failing. Note that in the
SSDT, the power resource NVP3 was referenced before it was defined,
could that result in this enumeration failure? Relevant SSDT excerpt:

    Scope (\_SB.PCI0.RP05)
    {
        Name (_PR3, Package (0x01)  // _PR3: Power Resources for D3hot
        {
            NVP3
        })
        // ...
    }

    PowerResource (NVP3, 0x00, 0x0000)

Kind regards,
Peter

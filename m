Actually, it is not completely true. This API isn't mandatory for the =

drivers to implement. We could only modify the drivers we need in =

nouveau and leave the others untouched but this is only good for as a =

transition from the sysfs-only interface to the new interface.

I agree that changing hwmon in the way we are asking is a big change in =

philosophy, but what are you suggesting? We can't just re-implement the =

needed i2c drivers in nouveau and the only way we can access the already =

existing i2c drivers is through sysfs.

The real question is why hwmon only is targeted for the userland? =

Another question is, why is the actual code of the drivers buried so =

deep inside the implementation details of the sysfs interface (this is =

what makes it so painful to update)?

Actually, this proposal could save space as once this interface is =

adopted by some drivers, all the sysfs-related code could be shared in =

hwmon.c.

Another proposal could be to access the drivers through sysfs, but I =

don't know if it is possible and I think it would be abusing the sysfs =

interface anyway.

I think you now understand our situation a bit better, do you have any =

suggestion? I really wish to find an agreement on this as not sharing =

the code is not an option for me.

The ACPI device will point at the correct PCI device. Associating it 
with the appropriate connector is theoretically possible in the case of 
open drivers, but I hadn't seen it as a high priority since (in 
practice) there's no situations where an ACPI interface will be able to 
control more than one backlight.

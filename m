--- Comment #3 from Ilia Mirkin <imirkin-FrUbXkNCsVf2fBVCVOL8/A@public.gmane.org> ---
This is moderately well-known by now. You can try my branch at

https://github.com/imirkin/mesa/commits/locking

which has helped some people. However it's incomplete and I don't plan on
pushing it in its current state.

You can remove nouveau_dri.so from your installation, or avoid using
applications that use multi-threaded rendering (this is a *very* recent tre=
nd,
up until recently the only applications that used GL were games/CAD tools, =
and
only very rarely used multi-threaded rendering). For well-supported open-so=
urce
drivers, consider Intel or AMD for your next purchase.

Yes. For Tegra I think it makes sense to move DVS out of the individual
drivers. Then we can share the code which has to deal with building the OPP
tables with other DVS rails (eg. vdd_core) for example. Often there are also
chip specific quirks to be dealt with (such as the maximum allowed voltage step
or voltage relationships between rails), which are easier to handle in common
code.

Cheers,

Peter.

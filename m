b) was introduced by Dave, I never asked for it because I don't mind =

duplicating sensor data (one hwmon device named nouveau and one for the =

raw access to the i2c chip).
My only wish was to provide a simple way for users to read/change their =

fan speed and get the GPU temperature no matter if their card have an =

i2c controller or not.
I do agree that sanitizing could be of interest, I especially think =

about tweaking the temperature value with parameters stored inside the =

vbios.

I am fully open to suggestions as long as it involves sharing the code =

in one way or another.

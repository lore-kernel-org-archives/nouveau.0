Dear Ilia,

unfortunately, I have only bad news to report:

- the nouveau options that you have suggested does not produce the
expected resuls; nouveau.config=NvAGP=0 (I'm using Linux blsw
4.4.0-1-parisc64-smp #1 SMP Debian 4.4.6-1 (2016-03-17) parisc64
GNU/Linux) and nouveau.vram_pushbuf=1 does not fix the issue about
NVIDA AGP init. The error is still there and the video card works in
frame buffer mode only

- I have tried another, more recent, NVIDIA AGP card (NV36GL [Quadro
FX 1100] (rev a1)): this model, with or without options, is not able
to make X11 works.

- I have tried also a PCI video card (ATI 9200), but with this model
the c8000 is not ble to complete the internal diagnostic,so the Linux
boot does not start

> <Cpu0> 0e000e7a00e00000  600601005d441002  CC_IODISC_PCI_DEVICE_CONFIG
> pci_bus_walk line 2878 - bridge aperture too big

then ..... the system boot process STOPs:
<Cpu1> e000108401e00000  0000000000000000  CC_BOOT_BOOT_FAILURE
<Cpu1> 030010d501e00000  0000000000000000  CC_CPU_STOP

The problem is elsewhere. "TTM" module ? I'm perplexed and confused.

Helge Deller told me that the hppa linux branch does not have a
working kgdb support, therefore my only chance to find and fix this
_very_nasty_ bug is insert some "printk" and hope to be able to find
the source of the issue.

Any idea ?

Thanks in advance for the help

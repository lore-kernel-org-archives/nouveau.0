The lifetime of a "proper" IOMMU API default domain is that of the 
iommu_group, so more or less between device_add() and device_del() from 
the perspective of a device in that group. IOW at least one level below 
what that device's driver should be messing with. The domain itself is 
just a little bit of memory and shouldn't have to occupy any hardware 
resources while it's not active (and yes, I know the ARM SMMU driver is 
currently a bit crap in that regard).

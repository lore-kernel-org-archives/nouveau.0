FWIW - I think for the time being I'm going to fixup these patches and
send out another version so we can get this pushed upstream sooner then
later. I am still planning on digging into this further - running this
patch series on my laptop got things much more stable then previously
but it definitely doesn't seem to have fixed everything (unfortunately
the remaining issues I am seeing don't have any clear reproducer yet)
So I get the feeling the next step we should probably be following is
ensuring we actually handle the comptag storage stuff properly on
runtime suspend.

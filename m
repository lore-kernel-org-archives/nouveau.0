The whole device private handling in hmm and migrate_vma seems pretty
broken as far as I can tell, and I have some WIP patches.  Basically we
should not touch (or possibly eventually call migrate to ram eventually
in the future) device private pages not owned by the caller, where I
try to defined the caller by the dev_pagemap_ops instance.
